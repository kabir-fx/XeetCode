    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Intuition: a ^(XOR) 0 = a, i.e every no. xor with 0 is equal to the no. itself; Also if we take 3 no out of which 2 are similar we observe after XOR that the resultant is always equal to unique no.

        # Since there is only one unique no in the ques, we xor it with all the n.
        res = 0
